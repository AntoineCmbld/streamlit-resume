        ### I have always been passionate about technology and science. Over the years, I discovered programming and the power of IT tools in the lives of individuals and businesses. The time saved through the use of the internet and applications continues to fascinate me, especially with new machine learning technologies that have led to the creation of generative AIs like ChatGPT.

        ### Recent advancements in artificial intelligence and data science have profoundly influenced my professional aspirations. Currently engaged in a work-study program specializing in Big Data and Machine Learning, I am eager to apply what I have learned at EFREI to a real-world project in a company.

        ### I am seeking a 2-year work-study position in the data field starting in September 2024, with a schedule of 3 days at the company and 2 days of training.
